Innovation backed by decades of experience.\n\nAfter over 70 years of experience, we have established and maintained relationships with the world’s purest raw material suppliers. Every single product from start to finish goes through multiple quality control processes, allowing us to ensure the absolute best quality product, every time.\n\nWe have combined what we know best in nutrition, with our extensive knowledge of plant’s requirements and created specific programs for a variety of crops. \n\nSolubility means everything you buy goes into the plant – not to the bottom of your concentrate tank or plugging your emitters. When you buy a 25-pound bag of Plantex, your plants receive every ounce of that fertilizer.\n\nMaster Plant-Prod® achieves this level of solubility by using the highest of quality raw materials on the market. Using these ingredients also means that you can use less fertilizer to grow better plants. The various chelating agents within our micronutrient packages ensure that nutrients are available at a wide pH range. The elevated level of the micronutrients being delivered produces darker, greener plants, even at lower feeding rates. Plantex can be applied in a variety of ways, including soil, foliar and hydroponics due to its low salt content when in concentration.\n\nNot only is Plantex the logical choice based on quality, but it is the economical choice. Paying the appropriate cost for the highest quality product up front saves our customers money throughout. Plantex will not cake or clog your emitters, injectors or screens, nor will your plants be nutrient deficient due to remaining sediment on the bottom of your tank. Money is now in your pocket rather than spent on cleaning and replacing. Plantex provides quality nutrition that you can count on and is reflected in your plants.\n\nPlantex Water Soluble Fertilizers have been produced for close to 70 years. Our products and staff have sustained the company throughout these decades with the highest quality products and services. We offer many years of international technical experience through training for sales representatives, and on farm visits to assist growers. Few fertilizer brands are found consistently around the world, and Plant-Prod is one of them. We are distinct from other brands by our product quality, solubility and 25-pound packaging. In addition, we offer the production of customized products according to your specifications.\n\nPlantex- a global presence with a local interest.",

It’s like the music industry. Each time a song gets played, the musician gets paid a royalty. It’s the same system for plant breeders.\n\nTHROUGH MARKETING: On point, on-trend, and clever. We want our plants to stand out as something growers, designers, and even the inexperienced gardener desire. We engage consumers, designers, and growers to create demand.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK? We find the plants – or the plants find us. We cooperate with trial sites worldwide. Once the plant passes our evaluation process, we file for plant patents and plant breeder's rights to protect the inventor. Finally,  we license growers and collect royalties for the breeder.",

Innovation backed by decades of experience.\n\nAfter over 70 years of experience, we have established and maintained relationships with the world’s purest raw material suppliers. Every single product from start to finish goes through multiple quality control processes, allowing us to ensure the absolute best quality product, every time.\n\nWe have combined what we know best in nutrition, with our extensive knowledge of plant’s requirements and created specific programs for a variety of crops. \n\nSolubility means everything you buy goes into the plant – not to the bottom of your concentrate tank or plugging your emitters. When you buy a 25-pound bag of Plantex, your plants receive every ounce of that fertilizer.\n\nMaster Plant-Prod® achieves this level of solubility by using the highest of quality raw materials on the market. Using these ingredients also means that you can use less fertilizer to grow better plants. The various chelating agents within our micronutrient packages ensure that nutrients are available at a wide pH range. The elevated level of the micronutrients being delivered produces darker, greener plants, even at lower feeding rates. Plantex can be applied in a variety of ways, including soil, foliar and hydroponics due to its low salt content when in concentration.\n\nNot only is Plantex the logical choice based on quality, but it is the economical choice. Paying the appropriate cost for the highest quality product up front saves our customers money throughout. Plantex will not cake or clog your emitters, injectors or screens, nor will your plants be nutrient deficient due to remaining sediment on the bottom of your tank. Money is now in your pocket rather than spent on cleaning and replacing. Plantex provides quality nutrition that you can count on and is reflected in your plants.\n\nPlantex Water Soluble Fertilizers have been produced for close to 70 years. Our products and staff have sustained the company throughout these decades with the highest quality products and services. We offer many years of international technical experience through training for sales representatives, and on farm visits to assist growers. Few fertilizer brands are found consistently around the world, and Plant-Prod is one of them. We are distinct from other brands by our product quality, solubility and 25-pound packaging. In addition, we offer the production of customized products according to your specifications.\n\nPlantex- a global presence with a local interest.",

It’s like the music industry. Each time a song gets played, the musician gets paid a royalty. It’s the same system for plant breeders.\n\nTHROUGH MARKETING: On point, on-trend, and clever. We want our plants to stand out as something growers, designers, and even the inexperienced gardener desire. We engage consumers, designers, and growers to create demand.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK? We find the plants – or the plants find us. We cooperate with trial sites worldwide. Once the plant passes our evaluation process, we file for plant patents and plant breeder's rights to protect the inventor. Finally,  we license growers and collect royalties for the breeder.",

    "about": "Star® Roses and Plants has been bringing great plants to the world’s gardens since 1897.  Many notable roses, shrubs and perennials have made it to market, but one of the most impressive is The Knock Out® Family of Roses. Introduced in 2000, this family of extremely floriferous, low-maintenance shrub roses revolutionized the way we think of roses. Equally impressive is our collection of groundcover roses, Drift® Roses, which offer a more compact solution to gardens of all sizes. Similarly beautiful, Sunblaze® Roses are a superb selection of vibrantly colored, miniature roses that are hardy, compact and easy to grow. \n\nWith more to offer than just roses, Star® Roses and Plants also has breakthrough woodies, edibles, and trees. The Bloomables® program is made up of our best flowering roses, woodies and perennials that are easy to grow for the grower and consumer, and Bushel and Berry® is our collection of compact, self-pollinating, berry plants for the home garden. These blueberries, raspberries, blackberries and strawberries are easy to grow and easy to love! Our extensive woody program is similarly distinct and includes notable Buxus, Hydrangea, and Hibiscus varieties, among others. Last, but certainly not least, our tree program offers unique, ground-breaking varieties that truly stand out in the landscape.  \n\nAt Star® Roses and Plants, we are a family of brands. We always learn from the plants we trial and are proud to bring innovative plants and programs to market so that your gardening experience is a little happier as a result!",

    "about": "Star® Roses and Plants has been bringing great plants to the world’s gardens since 1897.  Many notable roses, shrubs and perennials have made it to market, but one of the most impressive is The Knock Out® Family of Roses. Introduced in 2000, this family of extremely floriferous, low-maintenance shrub roses revolutionized the way we think of roses. Equally impressive is our collection of groundcover roses, Drift® Roses, which offer a more compact solution to gardens of all sizes. Similarly beautiful, Sunblaze® Roses are a superb selection of vibrantly colored, miniature roses that are hardy, compact and easy to grow. \n\nWith more to offer than just roses, Star® Roses and Plants also has breakthrough woodies, edibles, and trees. The Bloomables® program is made up of our best flowering roses, woodies and perennials that are easy to grow for the grower and consumer, and Bushel and Berry® is our collection of compact, self-pollinating, berry plants for the home garden. These blueberries, raspberries, blackberries and strawberries are easy to grow and easy to love! Our extensive woody program is similarly distinct and includes notable Buxus, Hydrangea, and Hibiscus varieties, among others. Last, but certainly not least, our tree program offers unique, ground-breaking varieties that truly stand out in the landscape.  \n\nAt Star® Roses and Plants, we are a family of brands. We always learn from the plants we trial and are proud to bring innovative plants and programs to market so that your gardening experience is a little happier as a result!",

    "about": "We are a company built & run by passionate plantswomen.\nWe help bring new garden plants from around the world to your local retailer. \n\nBY LICENSING: Growers from all over the world grow the plants we represent and pay a royalty to us, which is shared with the breeder. It’s like the music industry. Each time a song gets played, the musician gets paid a royalty. It’s the same system for plant breeders.\n\nTHROUGH MARKETING: On point, on-trend, and clever. We want our plants to stand out as something growers, designers, and even the inexperienced gardener desire. We engage consumers, designers, and growers to create demand.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK? We find the plants – or the plants find us. We cooperate with trial sites worldwide. Once the plant passes our evaluation process, we file for plant patents and plant breeder's rights to protect the inventor. Finally,  we license growers and collect royalties for the breeder.",

We want our plants to stand out as something growers, designers, and even the inexperienced gardener desire. We engage consumers, designers, and growers to create demand.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK? We find the plants – or the plants find us. We cooperate with trial sites worldwide. Once the plant passes our evaluation process, we file for plant patents and plant breeder's rights to protect the inventor. Finally,  we license growers and collect royalties for the breeder.",
